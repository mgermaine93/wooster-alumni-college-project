# Wooster Alumni College Audio Files

This repo hosts small homemade audio files to be used in my Wooster Alumni College course, "Wooster, Wine, and Web Design". All audio included here is my own and intended for use only in noncommercial practice projects.

These audio files should be accessible on places like CodePen. While there are likely many ways to access them, the best way I found is to do the following:

1.  Create a variable and assign it to the RAW value of the github link to the file:

    `const sound1 = https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mgermaine93/wac-project/main/test-recording.mp3`

2.  Use a method to "play" the audio. For JavaScript, this can be `.play()`:

    `sound1.play();`

3.  Add the respective HTML and CSS to make a button and have at it!
